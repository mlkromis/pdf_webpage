### README

* In the public folder, there is a PDF of the California application (public/application.pdf). The goal of this coding challenge is to figure out how we can programmatically fill out the PDF.

## Part 1 -

* Take a look at existing gems or Ruby libraries that help with filling out pdfs.
Play around with a few and decide which one you would like to use. I definitely
recommend using an existing library or gem for this challenge.

* In the gemfile of this app I have included gem 'pdf-forms', but there are certainly
other options to use.


## Part 2 -

* Build a basic rails form to take the first few fields on the application - just the first few fields would be great (name, address and phone).

* When the form is submitted, take the inputs and use them to populate the PDF.


* If you have questions or get stuck, please don't hesitate to email me at
genevieve@mrelief.com. Once you have finished Part 1 and 2, please send the entire app back to me. Thank you so much and I look forward to reviewing your work.
